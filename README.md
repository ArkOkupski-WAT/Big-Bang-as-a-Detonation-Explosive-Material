## ðŸ“„ Abstract

The paper proposes a cosmological model where the Big Bang is analogous to the detonation of an explosive material. The core idea is that the annihilation of a pre-existing, metastable matter-antimatter condensate provided the energy that not only created the observable particles and radiation but also generated spacetime itself and endowed it with its expansive property, identified as dark energy. The model posits that baryogenesis was always conserved, with antimatter being geometrically separated to the hypothetical edge of the Universe due to differences in gravitational interaction.
